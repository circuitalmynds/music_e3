German Masquerade was on Danish TV show Eldorado in 1984, and performed the smash hit 'Guardian Angel'. 

The composer of the song is Drafi Deutscher, who's also singing both voices (the low and high voices). There has been many discussions about who are performing behind the masks. Some people think it's Drafi and Stefan KÃ¶rber, but the truth is, that it's NOT Drafi Deutscher. The two performers you see are two substitutes from Hamburg and they are only miming to Drafi's singing. 

Why Drafi chose to let two substitutes perform his Guardian Angel song is unknown, but in the 80's it was quite common to let other persons mime to your songs (just think of Boney M and Milli Vanilli). Drafi Deutscher has written many songs for other artists - among them Boney M's 'Belfast'. 

Drafi was also the "head" behind the group Mixed Emotions. 

With HUGE thanks to Drafi Deutscher expert 'Gebegern'.
