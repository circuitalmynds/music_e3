When this recording was made, the Orpheans still had two directors - Carroll Gibbons and Howard Jacobs. Shortly afterwards, Howard Jacobs left the Orpheans and formed his own band which played at the Berkley Hotel. A delightfully smooth performance (arranged probably by Paul Fenhoulet), of a song recorded by a few bands that year.
