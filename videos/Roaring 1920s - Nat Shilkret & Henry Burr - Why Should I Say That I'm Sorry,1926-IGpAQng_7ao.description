Nat Shilkret & His Orchestra, Vocal refrain by Henry Burr -- Why Should I Say That I'm Sorry?, Fox Trot (Larry Conley), Victor 1926 (USA)

NOTE: Nat Shilkret (1889 -- 1982) was an American composer, clarinetist, pianist and conductor of the Jewish-Austrian origin, who was between 1926-35 the light music recording director in Victor Records company. He led also one of the best dance orchestras in USA thru 1920s/30s. Hundreds of his dance recordings he made for Victor under his own name as well as International Novelty Orchestra, All Star Orchestra or Victor Dance Orchestra need no recommendation and fortunately, many of them can be listened to in the web as well as in You Tube. This little known recording of a hot fox trot /charleston from 1926, is a rare gem also because of  the Vocal chorus made by brilliant Canadian tenor, Henry Burr http://youtu.be/rI7wqaYvcs8
